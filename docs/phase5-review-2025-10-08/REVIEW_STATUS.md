## 🔴 CRITICAL: SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md (June 25, 2025)

### What's Missing (Phase 4 Features)
1. **5 AI Agents**
   - ❌ Query Agent not documented
   - ❌ Search Agent not documented
   - ❌ Analysis Agent not documented
   - ❌ Data Quality Agent not documented
   - ❌ Recommendation Agent not documented

2. **GPT-4 Integration**
   - ❌ OpenAI API integration not shown
   - ❌ LLM service layer not documented
   - ❌ Prompt engineering pipeline missing

3. **Authentication System**
   - ❌ JWT token management not shown
   - ❌ User registration/login endpoints missing
   - ❌ Protected route architecture not documented

4. **Dashboard Features**
   - ❌ Real-time search not documented
   - ❌ AI analysis flow not shown
   - ❌ Data quality predictions missing

### What's There (Good!)
✅ Core layer structure (config, exceptions, logging, models)
✅ GEO tools layer structure
✅ NLP processing layer structure
✅ Basic API layer structure
✅ High-level architecture diagram

### Update Required
**Must update to reflect:**
- Multi-agent architecture (5 agents)
- LLM integration layer (GPT-4)
- Authentication/authorization system
- Modern API structure (/api/agents/*, /api/auth/*)
- Dashboard architecture

**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

---

## ✅ CURRENT: BACKEND_FRONTEND_CONTRACT.md (Oct 7, 2025)

### What's Good
✅ Framework-agnostic specification
✅ Clear API endpoints documented
✅ Data flow diagrams
✅ Request/response schemas
✅ Error handling patterns
✅ Workflow sequences

### What It Includes
1. **API Surface:**
   - `/api/v1/search` - Search endpoints
   - `/api/v1/agents` - LLM analysis endpoints
   - `/api/v1/analysis` - Citation, biomarker, quality, trends
   - `/api/v1/export` - Export formats
   - `/api/v1/config` - Configuration

2. **Data Flows:**
   - Basic search flow
   - Advanced search flow
   - AI analysis flow
   - Export flow

### Minor Updates Needed
- [ ] Add authentication endpoints (`/api/auth/*`)
- [ ] Update with actual Phase 4 endpoint paths
- [ ] Add performance metrics (20-30s search, 13-15s analysis)

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

---

## 🟡 NEEDS REVIEW: API_REFERENCE.md

### Questions to Answer
1. Does it include Phase 4 endpoints?
   - `/api/agents/analyze`
   - `/api/agents/qa`
   - `/api/agents/recommend`
   - `/api/auth/register`
   - `/api/auth/login`
   - `/api/auth/refresh`

2. Are request/response schemas up to date?
3. Are authentication headers documented?
4. Are error responses defined?

**Action:** Read full document and update

---

## 🟡 NEEDS REVIEW: Integration & Flow Docs

### INTEGRATION_LAYER_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Does it show how to use SearchClient?
- [ ] Does it show how to use AnalysisClient?
- [ ] Does it show how to use AuthClient?
- [ ] Are error patterns documented?

### DATA_FLOW_INTEGRATION_MAP.md
- [ ] Does it show end-to-end search flow?
- [ ] Does it show AI analysis flow?
- [ ] Does it show authentication flow?
- [ ] Are transformation points clear?

### AI_ANALYSIS_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md
- [ ] Does it reflect GPT-4 integration?
- [ ] Does it show 13-15s performance?
- [ ] Are all steps documented?

**Action:** Read and validate each document

---

## ✅ CURRENT: Frontend Design Docs (Oct 8, 2025)

### ALTERNATIVE_FRONTEND_DESIGNS.md

## 📝 Review Notes

### What's Working Well
✅ BACKEND_FRONTEND_CONTRACT.md is comprehensive and current
✅ Frontend design docs are ready for implementation
✅ Phase 5 roadmap is clear and actionable

### What Needs Work
⚠️ SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md is 4 months outdated (June → October)
⚠️ Missing Phase 4 features in architecture docs
⚠️ API documentation needs validation

### Critical Gaps
🔴 No end-to-end flow diagram showing:
   - User login → Token → Dashboard → Search → AI Analysis → Results
🔴 No performance metrics documented in architecture
🔴 No multi-agent system architecture diagram

---

## ✅ Success Criteria for Review Complete
