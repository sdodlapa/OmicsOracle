## 🎯 Review Goals

1. **Validate Current State:** Ensure all docs reflect Phase 4 completion
2. **Identify Gaps:** Find missing documentation or outdated information
3. **Update for Phase 5:** Prepare docs for frontend implementation
4. **Document Integration Points:** Clear backend ↔ frontend communication
5. **Define End-to-End Flows:** Complete user journey documentation

---

## 📝 Review Process

### Step 1: Read Each Document (30 min)
- Focus on architecture and integration docs first
- Note discrepancies or outdated info
- Mark sections that need updates

### Step 2: Cross-Reference (15 min)
- Verify consistency across documents
- Check if API docs match integration layer
- Ensure frontend designs align with backend capabilities

### Step 3: Document Updates Needed (15 min)
- Create list of required updates
- Prioritize critical vs nice-to-have
- Estimate update effort

### Step 4: Update Critical Docs (1-2 hours)
- Start with SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md
- Update BACKEND_FRONTEND_CONTRACT.md
- Create missing flow diagrams if needed

---

## 🚀 Next Steps After Review

1. **Update Architecture Docs** - Reflect Phase 4 completion
2. **Validate API Documentation** - Ensure accuracy
3. **Create Missing Diagrams** - Visual flow representations
4. **Finalize Frontend Design** - Select from alternatives
5. **Begin Phase 5 Sprint 1** - With validated documentation

## 📄 Key Questions to Answer

### Architecture
- Does the system architecture reflect all 5 AI agents?
- Is the GPT-4 integration documented?
- Is the authentication system architecture shown?

### Integration
- Are all backend → frontend integration points documented?
- Is the data transformation pipeline clear?
- Are error handling patterns defined?

### API
- Are all Phase 4 endpoints documented?
- Are request/response schemas complete?
- Is authentication flow clear?

### Frontend
- Which design option are we implementing?
- What's the component structure?
- How does it integrate with the backend?
