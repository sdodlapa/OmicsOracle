# Old Root Documentation (October 2025)

This directory contains documentation files that were previously in the repository root.
These files were moved during the October 2025 documentation cleanup.

## Why These Were Moved

Root directory should only contain:
- README.md - Main project README
- README_NEW.md - Updated README (pending replacement)
- Essential config files (pyproject.toml, etc.)

All other documentation belongs in organized `docs/` subdirectories.

## Files Archived Here

### Duplicate Files
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Duplicate of docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- `QUICK_START.md` - Duplicate of docs/QUICK_START.md

### Old Reorganization Docs
- `CODEBASE_REORGANIZATION.md` - October 2025 reorganization summary
- `REORGANIZATION_COMPLETE.md` - Reorganization completion notice

These represent historical reorganization efforts and are kept for reference.
