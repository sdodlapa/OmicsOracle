However, the abstract does not provide specific details on how the dataset was applied, the research question being investigated, the application domain, or the methodology employed. There is also no information on sample size, key findings, clinical relevance, clinical details, novel biomarkers discovered, or the validation status of any findings. The confidence in this analysis is high (0.9) because the citation context directly mentions the use of TCGA data, but it is not 1.0 due to the lack of detailed information on the application and outcomes of using the dataset.\"\n}", "model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview"}
