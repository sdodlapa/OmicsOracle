Given the context of leveraging 'large-scale genomic efforts' and the focus on TP53 mutations, it is highly likely that the TCGA database was used for obtaining and analyzing the raw data on TP53 mutations across cancers. The specific mention of 'our analysis spans multiple cancer types' supports the conclusion that the authors not only cited TCGA for background but actively used its data for their research. However, without explicit statements of downloading or processing TCGA data, there remains a slight uncertainty, hence the confidence level is not at the maximum.\"\n}", "model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview"}
