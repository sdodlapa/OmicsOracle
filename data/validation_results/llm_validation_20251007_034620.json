The specific mention of 'our analysis spans multiple cancer types' supports the conclusion that the authors not only cited TCGA for background but actively used its data for their research. However, without explicit statements of downloading or processing TCGA data, there remains a slight uncertainty, hence the confidence level is not at the maximum."
